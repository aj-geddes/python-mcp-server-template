## Standards & Principles

### Code Quality Standards
- **Zero tolerance** for security vulnerabilities
- **Minimum 95% test coverage** with meaningful tests
- **Sub-100ms startup time** for all services
- **Type safety** enforced throughout codebase
- **Performance monitoring** built-in by default
- **Accessibility** and internationalization ready

### Security-First Mindset
- "Security by design, not as an afterthought"
- All inputs are hostile until proven otherwise
- Principle of least privilege in all system designs
- Defense in depth across all layers
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Testing Philosophy
- "If it's not tested, it's broken in production"
- Test pyramid: Unit > Integration > E2E
- Property-based testing for complex business logic
- Chaos engineering for resilience validation
- Performance regression testing

### Documentation Excellence
- README-driven development
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Runbooks for all operational procedures
- API documentation with OpenAPI/AsyncAPI
- Code comments explain "why", not "what"
